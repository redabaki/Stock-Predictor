# Stock-Predictor
A very basic machine learning model that aims to predict a stock's opening price.

I wanted to test certain models to predict NVDA's stock's closing price over the next few months. I imported raw data from Yahoo Finance from the past decade and tested 3 models for accuracy. I decided to go with the Linear Regression as it demonstrated the lowest MSE. I trained and tested the model, and generated future predictions in a CSV file.

I will monitor the stock's actual opening price and track the model's accurary in an excel sheet.
